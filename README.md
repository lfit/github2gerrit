# github2gerrit action

The action extracts the commits from a GitHub pull-request and submits them to an upstream Gerrit repository. This allows GitHub developers to contribute to Gerrit-based repositories that are primarily maintained on Gerrit servers and replicated onto GitHub.

## Pre-requisites

1. GitHub replication is set up on the Gerrit repository over SSH. Refer to the [Gerrit replication configuration setup guide](https://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/en/latest/infra/gerrit.html) maintained by the Linux Foundation release engineering team. This also requires creating ssh-keypair
   and [registering the SSH keys](https://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/en/latest/gerrit.html#register-key-gerrit) with Gerrit.
2. Create a user account on GitHub with permissions to submit changes to Gerrit and ensure it is added to the GitHub organization or repository as a member.
3. Use a [.gitreview](https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/git-review/latest/installation.html#gitreview-file-format) file point to the Gerrit server and repository. If this not alternatively pass the GERRIT_SERVER or GERRIT_PROJECT as inputs to the workflow.

## How the Action Works

The action and workflow are written with bash scripts using well known Git SCM tools, gh, jq and git-review.

1. The action is triggered when a new pull request is created on a GitHub repository configured with the action.
1. One of the three below options can be used depending on the workflow followed by the community.

Squash all the commits in the pull request into a single commit, with one of these two options:

- Consolidate the commit titles and body into a single commit (Default).
- Use the pull request title and body as the commit title and body (USE_PR_AS_COMMIT).

Or, submit each commit as a separate single commit preserving the git history (SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS).

1. Check for a Change-Id line in the pull request commit message. If it is not present, add the Change-Id to the commit. If the Change-Id is found in any of the commits, it will be reused along with the patch.
1. Add the Change-Id (and optionally squash changes into a single commit if required).
1. Add a pull-request and workflow run reference link as a comment on the Gerrit change that was created for committers or reviewers to back reference to the source of change request.
1. Add a comment to the pull request with the URL to the change. Any updates will require the pull request to be reopened and updates to the pull request must be done with a force push, which triggers the workflows to ensure the change is resubmitted.
1. Close the pull request once the Gerrit patch is submitted successfully.

## Features

### Use pull-request as a single squashed commit message

- Commits in a pull request are squashed into a single commit before submitting the change request to Gerrit. This is the default behavior shown in the caller workflow examples.
- Merge commits get filtered out.
- Here `inputs.SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS` is set to 'false' by default.
- When the commits are updated on Github and the pull request is reopened the `Change-id: <SHA>` is retried from the
    comment on the pull request if one exist. It's the developer responsibility to ensure change-Id's are reused.

### Use pull-request body and title in the commit message

- The commit message title and body is extracted from the pull request body and title along with the change-Id and Signed-off-by lines. Commits are still squashed and while only the commit body and title are discarded.
- Requires setting `inputs.USE_PR_AS_COMMIT` to 'true'.
- This option is exclusive with `inputs.SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS` and cannot be used together.

### Submit each commit as a separate single commit

- Each commit in the pull request are processed individually as a single commit before submitting to Gerrit repository. This option allows you to preserve git history.
- Requires `inputs.SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS` to be set to 'true' in the caller.

## Caveats - Future Improvements

- `inputs.SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS` has not be tested extensively for handling large pull requests.
- Code review comments on Gerrit are not synchronized back to the pull request comment, therefore requires developers to follow up on the Gerrit change request URL. Rework through the recommended changes can be done by reopening the pull request and updating to the commits through a force push.

## Required Inputs

- `GERRIT_KNOWN_HOSTS`: Known host of the Gerrit repository.
- `GERRIT_SSH_PRIVKEY_G2G`: SSH private key pair (The private key has to be added to the Gerrit user's account settings. Gerrit -> User Settings).
- `GERRIT_SSH_USER_G2G`: Gerrit server username (Required to connect to Gerrit).
- `GERRIT_SSH_USER_G2G_EMAIL`: Email of the Gerrit user.

## Optional Inputs

- `SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS`: Submit one commit at a time to the Gerrit repository (Default: false)
- `USE_PR_AS_COMMIT`: Use commit body and title from pull-request (Default: false)
- `FETCH_DEPTH`: fetch-depth of the clone repo. (Default: 10)
- `GERRIT_PROJECT`: Gerrit project repository (Default read from .gitreview).
- `GERRIT_SERVER`: Gerrit server FQDN (Default read from .gitreview).
- `GERRIT_SERVER_PORT`: Gerrit server port (Default: 29418)
- `ORGANIZATION`: The GitHub Organization or Project.
- `REVIEWER_EMAIL`: Committers' email list (comma-separated list without spaces).

## Deploying to a New Linux Foundation Project

1. Create a new GitHub2Gerrit user LFID (this needs to be project specific)
1. Add user to the appropriate organisation/vault in 1Password (e.g. LF Networking/ONAP)
1. Get user added to the appropriate groups (with required Gerrit permissions)
1. Log in to Gerrit web interface/UI (this creates the user account in Gerrit)
1. Create a new SSH key-pair (ed25519) and the SSH key to the user's profile
1. Add the new SSH keys used to the appropriate 1Password vault
1. Add mandatory secrets/vars (documented above) to GitHub

It is recommended to only add secrets/variables to a repository during initial testing.
You can later move them to the ORGANISATION level when ready to go into production.

## Full Example Usage with Composite Action

Use the composite action as a step in the workflow for further processing.
Example workflow does not enable `SUBMIT_SINGLE_COMMITS` and `USE_PR_AS_COMMIT`
